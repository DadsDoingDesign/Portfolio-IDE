# Documentation Workflow Guide

## 📋 Documentation Update Process

This document outlines the required workflow for maintaining our project documentation. Following this process ensures we keep consistent, up-to-date records of our progress and technical knowledge.

### When to Update Documentation

Documentation must be updated after:
1. Completing any task in the project plan
2. Encountering and resolving a bug
3. Making significant architectural decisions
4. Implementing a major feature
5. Each development session (at minimum)

## 🔄 Required Update Workflow

### 1. Project Plan Updates
After completing any work:

- [ ] Update the status of completed tasks (🟡 Pending → 🟢 Completed)
- [ ] Add completion date
- [ ] Add any relevant notes about implementation
- [ ] Update project metrics (completion percentage)
- [ ] Update the "Last Updated" timestamp
- [ ] If applicable, update weekly status with progress made

### 2. Bug Log Updates
When encountering and resolving bugs:

- [ ] Create a new bug entry with next sequential ID
- [ ] Document all required fields (date, category, description, etc.)
- [ ] Add detailed reproduction steps
- [ ] Document the resolution approach and code changes
- [ ] Note any lessons learned
- [ ] Update the recurring issues tracker if applicable
- [ ] Update the "Last Updated" timestamp

### 3. LLM Training Data
When implementing features relevant to the chat system:

- [ ] Add relevant examples to training data
- [ ] Document new topics the LLM should be able to discuss
- [ ] Note any changes to embedding pipeline or context management

## 🔍 Documentation Review Checklist

Before concluding a work session, review:

- [ ] Are all completed tasks marked as such in the project plan?
- [ ] Have all encountered bugs been documented?
- [ ] Are weekly status updates current?
- [ ] Has project completion percentage been updated?
- [ ] Have you updated all timestamps?

## 📅 Documentation Schedule

- **Daily**: Update task statuses and bug log
- **Weekly**: Complete weekly status update section
- **Monthly**: Full documentation review and cleanup

## 🧠 Documentation Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Include enough detail that someone else could understand
2. **Be consistent** - Follow established formats and patterns
3. **Link related items** - Reference related bugs or tasks by ID
4. **Include code snippets** - When relevant to bug fixes or implementations
5. **Document "why" not just "what"** - Explain reasoning behind decisions
